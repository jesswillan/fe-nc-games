## Background
This is the React front-end of fe-nc-games, using the be-nc-games API. The project was completed during my time on the Northcoders coding bootcamp.
The app allows the user to view a list of game reviews and to view a single review by selecting a review card. Once viewing a single review, the user can vote for the review and leave a comment. 

**To leave a comment a valid username must be entered, please visit the link above to view a list of valid usernames.**
